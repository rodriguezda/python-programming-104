## Lab: EDA and Feature Engineering in Pandas

---

Welcome!

#### Pandas: Final Practice Problems

In this homework, you're going to write code for a few problems on two datasets:

* The [iris](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris) dataset - a dataset of flowers whose species is classified by attributes of their flower sizes
* The [NCAA March Madness](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018) dataset - a collection of ranks for teams in the March Madness sportsball competition.

You'll practice the following programming concepts we've covered in class:
* Basic EDA with Pandas.
* Using the `.apply()` method to create new feature columns and mutate existing columns
* Broadcasting, or implementing math transformations at column scale
* Dropping columns
* And much, much more!
