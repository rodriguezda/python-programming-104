    "\n",
    "- Joining is the process of taking a single dataframe and combining it with another dataframe.\n",
    "- Traditionally, this would be done with SQL.\n",
    "  - SQL is database designed and optimized to distribute data across many tables.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Join?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Joining is important because:\n",
    "  - It allows us to reduce the _size_ of a database.\n",
    "  - It allows us to _increase the speed_ at which data is queried and returned.\n",
    "  - It allows us to _reduce the redundancy_ of the data stored in the database.\n",
    "- Joining is fundamental to proper data architecture, and we'll get to do it in Pandas!\n",
    "\n",
    "<aside class=\"notes\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Tip**:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Pandas is based upon numpy, a linear algebra library.\n",
    "- Using it for joins makes sense - the algorithms are optimized and fast.\n",
    "- This allows allows us to use 'python only' - avoiding integrations to SQL.\n",
    "- This makes data analysis faster as we don't need to switch tools.\n",
    "- Longer term, code may be delegated to more specific tools (SQL, Spark, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<aside class=\"notes\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Tips**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's no silver bullet for tooling; each use case is different.\n",
    "- Remind students that pandas run on a machine and thus is limited by the machine.\n",
    "- SQL Server is designed (for enterprise cases) to be distributed, have backup plans, etc.\n",
    "- Be mindful to not give the students the idea that 'pandas can do everything'.\n",
    "- Emphasize that this is good for _prototyping_ and smaller, temporary jobs and analysis.\n",

    "- SQL uses `JOIN`. Pandas has *two* semi-equivalent functions:\n",
    "  - `pd.join` - used for joining dataframes _on their indices only_\n",
    "  - `pd.merge` - used for joining dataframes _on any column you want_\n",
    "- Since `pd.merge` is more powerful and generalizes better, we'll focus on `pd.merge`\n",
    "- SQL uses `UNION`. Pandas, again, has *two* semi-equivalent functions:\n",
    "  - `pd.append` - stacks dataframes _on top of_ each other\n",
    "  - `pd.concat` - stacks dataframes _on top of_ **or** _next to_ each other\n",
    "- Since `pd.concat` is more powerful and generalizes better, we'll focus on `pd.concat`\n",
    "\n",
    "<aside class=\"notes\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Tips**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that joining operations creates dataframes that _mesh into_ each other (use your hands and fingers to show this operation if you can).\n",
    "- Note that concat and append create dataframes that _stack_ on/next to each other (close your fingers and show this operation if you can).\n",
    "- You'll probably get questions about the differences between the operations:\n",
    "  - Note that _mesh into_ is somewhat vague, since you can have 1:m, m:1, 1:1, and m:m join types.\n",
    "  - Pandas `pd.merge` can handle these as well, and we touch on that briefly in the exercise.\n",
