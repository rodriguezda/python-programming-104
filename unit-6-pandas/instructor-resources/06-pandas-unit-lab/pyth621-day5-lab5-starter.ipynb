    "\n",
    "The raw data is a mixture of varying forms of data points taken at different time intervals. The \"FM-15\" report type is the hourly data, so we can pull this out and discard the rest. To do so, we add `.query(\"REPORT_TYPE == 'FM-15'\")` to the end of our `read_csv()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop all columns of data, leaving only the `HourlyDryBulbTemperature` and `HourlyPrecipitation` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to clean the data in these two columns:\n",
    "  - The data has added different letter characters at various places in the data. This has caused Pandas to read in all of the raw temperature and precipitation data as an object instead of a number. \n",
    "  - We need to change the type of all strings of data in each cell to `float64` and anything that's not a number to `0.0`. \n",
    "  - Use the following code to perform this transformation:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```hourly_weather_data = hourly_weather_data.apply(lambda x: pd.to_numeric(x, errors='coerce')).fillna(0.0).astype('float64')```\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Click here for details on how this apply method works.</summary>\n",
    "What this code does is apply a lambda function to all of the data. A lambda function is a way of adding a more complex manipulation to data and can be as complex as any function you'd write in normal Python. What the function is doing here is, via `to_numeric()`, converting strings to numbers wherever it can (e.g., `\"74\"` to `74`). The `errors='coerce'` parameter tells the function that, every time it encounters a string that it doesn't know how to convert to a number (e.g., `\"T\"` to `?`), it should convert that string to a blank cell instead. Then, `fillna(0.0)` converts all of the blank cells to `0.0` and `astype('float64')` ensures that all cells in the column are of the `float64` type.\n",
