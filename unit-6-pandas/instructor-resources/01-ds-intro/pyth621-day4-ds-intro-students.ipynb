    "This lesson introduces data science and its workflow, then jumps into a workflow exercise. It includes downloading Anaconda on student machines, so they're ready for the day's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "When it comes to installing Anaconda, it's important to be prepared to handle Mac v Windows across student machines. It is a good idea to delegate one IA to be the \"PC person\" for debugging said issues.\n",

    "- Defining a question and tying work against an objective is essential to emphasis because problems that progress without a hypothesis to prove or disprove ultimately become circular. There are a near infinite number of spurious correlations or \"interesting\" ideas to consider. Only those that further drive you towards on outcome are necessary.\n",

Reassure students that it is quite common to have datasets where the ground truth answers to questions like these are unknown.\n",

    "A recommended problem is like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frame:** Let's presume the key cost driver for this HR function is twofold: employees turning over early (low total years of service) and a high time to fill (positions going unfilled, costing producitivity losses). We'll aim to minimize turnover. Let's hypothesize we can explain how long an employee stays with the company based on their university, previous employment, and how they found our retail store, Data Science Wearables (DSW).\n",
    "- **Prepare:** We would want to create a consistent data standard for `Current Employee` -> `No` to `N` across the dataset. Moreover, we need to hypothesize why `NA` values exist. E.g. did the second candidate not have a previous employer, or was this data unavailable? (We do not know with the information given.)\n",
    "- **Analyze:** While we will dive deeper into analysis using Python soon enough, anecdotal evidence based on three observations seems to imply that Candidate Source is a useful explanatory variable. Employees that had experience with DSW previously (`Internship` and `Referral`) stayed longer. The relationship between waiting to fill (`Time to Fill (Days)`) and employee tenure may make a U-shape: an employee either previously knows of DSW (short time to fill)  and stays for a while because they liked it or DSW waited for the perfect candidate (long time to fill) and stayed for a while. School does not seem to have useful signal for employee tenure.\n",
    "- **Interpret:** It appears many of our explanatory factors helped, but not all, and not in ways we may have anticipated. `School` does not seem to yield valuable insight, but knowing an employee has been referred or had experience with DSW previously is a key signal. Perhaps DSW should expand their internship and employee referral programs.\n",
    "- **Communicate:** Our driving thesis is: The best candidates for DSW are those that have connected with the store in a previous way (internship, referral). Investing in these programs is recommended. Visualizations of average employee tenure segmented by these factors are encouraged.\n",

    "- **High level:** Python is _\"far from\"_ our computer's RAM and CPU, meaning it is less like binary (`01101010`) and closer to plaintext English. This makes Python comparatively more intuitive as a first language. Because data science is inherently a cross-functional discipline, allowing it to be picked up by all audiences is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open source:** Python's source code is free to use, and anyone can contribute to improve it. Being an open source language is a huge reason Python is a choice language for data science. As new techniques become available daily, developers from around the world race to implement said methods in Python libraries. (This places Python in contrast to closed source, paid data analysis tools like SAS and SPSS.)\n",
