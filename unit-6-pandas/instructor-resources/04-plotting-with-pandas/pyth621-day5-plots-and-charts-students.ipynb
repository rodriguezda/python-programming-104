    "- Use pandas to plot from three different datasets\n",

    "- Send out the presentation link.\n",
    "- Students will need the data sets and notebook. Consider having a zip file of all notebooks and data sets for the rest of the unit that you hand out at the beginning of this lesson. Alternatively, link them directly in GitHub - remember that they haven't learned GitHub, so you'll need to help them download the files.\n",

    "## Differentiation and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "- If students are excelling in the first half, consider deeper discussions surrounding five number summaries, data integrity, off-the-cuff filters and sorts\n",
    "- If students are struggling, work on the code more heavily than the **Class Questions** portions. Make the Independent Exercises be Collective Exercises (as a class)\n",

    "This lesson introduces the Pandas library and the beginnings of Exploratory Data Analysis. The majority of the lesson should be spent going through code -- whether that is via Jupyter Slides or a Jupyter Notebook demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To present this content, begin with `04-plotting-with-pandas.ipynb` to introduce Pandas as a library and data integrity. Transition to the Jupyter Notebook to introduce reading in data, column manipulation, filtering and sorting; conclude with exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Tips**:\n",
    "- There are **Class Questions** littered throughout the notebook. Use as much/little time on these as you see fit relative to how your class is pacing\n",
    "- There is no **Independent Exercise** at the end of this lesson. It is aspirational to have time to let students work entirely independently on this time-wise, so consider doing a guided code-along or paired programming. Use this time to have students set their own challenges.\n",
    "- Pause after learning objectives and level-set for what students will get out of the lesson\n",

    "## A Note on Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "- This unit's lessons will occur in [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "  - Slides will be an introduction to the lesson (no code, just overview)\n",
    "  - Then, we'll open a notebook and start coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "<aside class=\"notes\">\n",
    "**Teaching Tips**:\n",
    "- We could have made this into a speaker note, but it's helpful to get it out there so everybody's on the same page\n",

    "## Plotting with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas `.plot()` functionality is effectively a wrapper for [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a charting library for python and scientific computing\n",
    "- It's considered the de-facto standard for charting locally\n",
    "  - It's best for scientific papers, EDA, and general introspection of data\n",
    "  - It's not so great for production level charts that are embedded in applications (check out [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "<aside class=\"notes\">\n",
    "**Talking Points**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Talk briefly about where charts are interpreted, and why different tools may be advantageous\n",

    "\n",
    "## So, Pandas and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Whats a wrapper?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A program that _abstracts_ another program to modify its interface\n",
    "\n",
    "???\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas `.plot()` functionality references matplotlib behind the scenes\n",
    "- Matplotlib has a reputation for being fairly complex\n",
    "  - Even for fairly simple charts, you will frequently write loops\n",
    "  - A fairly plain chart can be 20-30 lines of code\n",
    "- Pandas helps us here and most charts can be produced with 1-2 lines of code\n",
    "  - Some functionality is reduced, but _effort is minimized in most cases_\n",
    "\n",
    "<aside class=\"notes\">\n",
    "**Talking Points**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encourage students to learn matplotlib on their own time if they wish\n",
    "- Many data science shops use matplotlib as a standard\n",
    "  - It's a bit older and a little hokey, but it's well supported, open source, and generally gets the job done\n",
    "- Take some time to talk about the balance between package complexity and utility overall - sometimes a good answer delivered on time beats a perfect answer delivered late\n",

    "- Football Records: International football results from 1872 to 2018\n",

    "- Chocolate Bar Ratings: Expert ratings of over 1,700 chocolate bars\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets have been graciously downloaded from Kaggle.com, and we'll discover that the right visualization can often replace a bit of fancy machine learning, if done properly.\n",

    "- Assure students that the above charts have been selected specifically to cover the majority of cases you'll encounter\n",

    "- Make sure all students can open and run their Notebooks. It's only the second time they've done so!\n",
    "- The presentation is also at the top of the Notebook, so students can later reference in one place. Jump down to `Importing Pandas`.\n",
