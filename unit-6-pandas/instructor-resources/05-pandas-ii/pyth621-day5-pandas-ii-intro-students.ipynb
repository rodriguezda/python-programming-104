    "## Overview\n",
    "This presentation is review - go through the lesson in the notebook first!\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to continue demonstrating valuable functions within the Pandas library for exploratory data analysis.  This lesson covers handling missing data and null values, then continues to implementing `groupby` and apply functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are **Class Questions** littered throughout the notebook. Use as much/little time on these as you see fit relative to how your class is pacing\n",
    "- This lesson includes high level slides and a Notebook. To present this content, it is recommended you begin directly with the Jupyter Notebook. The student slides contain the wrap-up of the big ideas covered in the notebook.\n",

    "- If students are excelling in the first half, consider deeper discussions surrounding types of missingness (missing at random, missing conditionally at random, not missing at random). Also, write a few more `groupby` statements.\n",
    "- If students are struggling, hone the conceptual elements of each portion heavily - the **why** for identifying and handling missing data, groupby, and apply functions. Note that the order of these lessons is in order of importance, so even if the latter half is rushed, students will be covering the major keys!\n",
