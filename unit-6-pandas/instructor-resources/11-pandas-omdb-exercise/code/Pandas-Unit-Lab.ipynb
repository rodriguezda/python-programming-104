    "# Pandas Unit Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "**Woo!** We've made it to the end of our Pandas Unit. Let's put our skills to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to explore data from some of the top movies according to IMDB. This is a guided question-and-response lab where some areas are specific asks and others are open ended for you to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important!!!\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">**There are two ways to do this lab!**</font>\n",
    "  - The first way is to read in a dataset that _has already been pulled from the API and cleaned for you_ (`movies_rated.csv`). This is the recommended 'first-pass' way to do this lab.\n",
    "  - _After you have completed the lab using the supplied_ `movies_rated.csv`, you can call the API yourself!\n",
    "  - Calling the API yourself takes time! Be prepared to parse lots of JSON, read docs, etc. Consider this a take-home exercise if the students desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will:\n",
    "- Use `movie_app.py` to obtain relevant moving rating data\n",
    "- Leverage Pandas to conduct exploratory data analysis, including:\n",
    "    - Assess data integrity\n",
    "    - Create exploratory visualizations\n",
    "    - Produce insights on top actors/actresses across films\n",
    "    \n",
