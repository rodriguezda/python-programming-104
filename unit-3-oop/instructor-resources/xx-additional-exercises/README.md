### Python Programming
## Supplemental Exercises

In this directory is a series of additional exercises, corresponding with the topics in this day-2 directory, that you can give to advanced students, if you have extra time, or as extra homework.

As the students don't know GitHub, link the files directly.

The topics covered by each are written in the Overview section of the file.
