# Reverse Lookup

## Overview:

Finding the value from a key is easy: `my_dictionary[key]`. But what if you only have the value and want to find the key?

There's no built-in function for this - you'll be writing it here.

You will practice these programming concepts we've covered in class:
* Functions
* Loops
* Dictionaries

## Deliverables

One `.py` file with code that solves the problem.

## Requirements
You task is to write a function that takes a dictionary and a value, returning the corresponding key.

For example:

```python
state_capitals = {
  "Alaska" : "Juneau",
  "Colorado" : "Denver",
  "Oregon" : "Salem",
  "Texas" : "Austin"
  }

print(reverse_lookup("Denver"))
# Prints Colorado
```
