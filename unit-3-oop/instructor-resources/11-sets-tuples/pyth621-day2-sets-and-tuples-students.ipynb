    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson focuses on sets and tuples. It starts with sets, encompassing  We Dos as new functions are introduced, then goes into tuples. It ends with the `type` function and a You Do. If there's time, after the \"Additional Reading\" slides, there is a sets exercise. This exercises are also in the `xx-additional-exercises` folder, if you don't get to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "- The students will be asked to build upon their knowledge of the `list`, so a solid understanding of this concept will be vital.\n",
    "- The \"why\" of each datatype is essential to impart to students and your checks for understanding may keep circling back around to the \"why\".\n",
    "- Much of this lesson contrasts the three data types (tuples, sets, lists) to each other, so that students can see them side by side and start to internalize the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform common actions with sets.\n",
    "- Perform common actions with tuples.\n",
    "- Know when to use each of the different collection structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "40 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing note:\n",
    "- If there's time remaining at the end, giving exercises involving multiple contrasting sets, tuples, and lists would be great.\n",
    "- There is, in the `xx-additional-exercises` folder in the parent folder, a set equals challenge that you should give in class if there's time, and if not, give as homework.\n",
