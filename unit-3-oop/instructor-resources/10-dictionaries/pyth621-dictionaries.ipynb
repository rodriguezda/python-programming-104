    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson introduces students to the concept of dictionaries. It begins with simple creation, printing, and changing values. It ends with a series of You Do exercises to build students' confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "This is the beginning of the object-oriented programming unit. Take a few minutes before starting this lesson to recap the idea of lists and storing elements in objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Perform common dictionary actions.\n",
    "- Build more complex dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing note:\n",
    "- If there's time remaining at the end, it'd be great to give exercises involving multiple types of values in dictionaries.\n",
    "- There is, in the `xx-additional-exercises` folder in the parent folder, a reverse lookup challenge that you should assign in class if there's time. If not, assign it as homework.\n",
