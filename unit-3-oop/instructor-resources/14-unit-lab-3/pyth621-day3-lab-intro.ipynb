    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson consists of a hands-on lab during which learners will independently create a working Python program. This lab builds on the previous lab, so starter code (which is the same solution code as the previous lab) is provided for them. You simply need to introduce the lab, make sure they have working starter code and that they can access the lab doc, and be available in case of questions. At the end, go over the solution (in the `solution-code` folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",

    "- Make sure you change the link or point out what PDF to look at, and check the starter code location.\n",
    "- Make sure all students start with working code — they can get it from the starter code file.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Remember, throughout the course, there is a lab at the end of each unit. Each lab builds upon the last.\n",

    "- Right now, let's set up the functions and control flow to print out the values of our variables.\n",
