    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson assumes knowledge of classes and dives straight into the concept of inheritance. After a We Do to build a child class, there's an I Do that walks through overwriting the parent variables and methods. If there's time, assign an exercise! It's in the `xx-additional-exercises` folder (it's too long for a slide). Otherwise, assign it for homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "- Students have just learned about classes! Go slowly here. Make sure everyone's confident with classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement inheritance.\n",
    "- Describe what has been inherited from one class to another.\n",
    "- Overwrite variables and methods.\n",

    "## Differentiation and Extensions\n",
    "- In the interest of time, this does not have a You Do for overwriting attributes or methods. It has a Knowledge Check question, but feel free to add exercises!\n",
    "- If students get this easily, introduce multiple inheritance — perhaps an `iPhone 8` class, inheriting from `IPhone`.\n",
    "- There is, in the `xx-additional-exercises` folder in the parent folder, an inheritance challenge that you should give in class if there's time. If not, give as homework. It's quite long.\n",
