    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson introduces students to the concept of functions, beginning with regular functions, then parameters, then multiple parameters. It continues with returning values from functions. It ends with a series of You Do exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Identify when to use a function.\n",
    "- Create and call a function with arguments.\n",
    "- Return a value from a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on timing:\n",
    "This functions lesson is designed to roll into the next one; it ends at a logical break to account for the class timing, but they go together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 5 day class, this means that the overall function lessons are designed to roll and continue in the next class. The homework doesn't have parameters, so if you don't get there, that's fine. Go as far as you can until the day is over, then pick up where you left off the next class. This lesson ends with a series of You Do exercises. **Student understanding is more important than staying within the timeframe** - the next lesson is flexible with many exercises that can be dropped.\n",
