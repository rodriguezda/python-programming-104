    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson starts with a review of the previous function lesson, leading into a few recap exercises. After that, it discusses `*args`, `kwargs`, and default argument values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "- Important Note: They don't know dictionaries yet! We introduce `**kwargs`, but are careful not to phrase it in terms of dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Use arbitrary numbers of arguments in functions.\n",
    "- Use keyword arguments in functions.\n",
    "- Use default values in functions.\n",
