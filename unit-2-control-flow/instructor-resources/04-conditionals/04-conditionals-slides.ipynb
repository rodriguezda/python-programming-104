    "This lesson introduces students to the concept of control flow — Booleans (including \"truthy\" and \"falsey\"), comparison operators, and `if`/`elif`/`else`.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",

    "- Use `if`/`elif`/`else` conditionals to control program flow.\n",

    "- If students are struggling, continuously recap the real-world comparison (e.g., a temperature range or comparing numbers), and once they grasp that, more slowly recap each individual concept. Start with the variables and an easier comparison, then build up. You can always add more simple demos, code-alongs, and exercises.\n",
