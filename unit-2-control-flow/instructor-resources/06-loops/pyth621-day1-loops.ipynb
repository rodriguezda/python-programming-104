    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson introduces students to the concept of creating `for` and `while` loops. It begins with `for`, covering lists and strings, then goes into using  `range` to modify a list. It then dives into `while` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Use a `for` loop to iterate a list.\n",
    "- Use `range()` to dynamically generate loops.\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop to control program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on timing:\n",
    "Loops are crucial to programming. If students are struggling, extend the amount of time here. You can generate exercises by  giving sample scenarios. Fizzbuzz is a great problem to give them, if you have time!\n",

This way when you do your loop comparison, you'll be comparing the same types.\"\n",
