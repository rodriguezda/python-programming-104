    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson introduces students to the concept of lists. This begins as basic list operations - accessing elements, `len`, `insert`, `append`, and `pop`.  After an exercise to recap that, it segues into operations on numerical lists - `sum`, `min`, and `max`. It ends with a longer exercise recapping the list operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Create lists in Python.\n",
    "- Print out specific elements in a list.\n",
    "- Perform common list operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "A 30 minute interval has been allotted for this lesson. You may finish up early due to the fact that this lesson doesn't get into loops or ranges. If you have extra time, put it on the activities or start the next lesson early so students do have buffer time later, when they need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, at the point you give this lesson, students are still on day one. They will require more time than you probably expect to poke around the code.\n",
