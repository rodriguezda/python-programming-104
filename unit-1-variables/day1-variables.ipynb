    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson introduces students to the concept of creating and assigning variables - numeric variables (including basic math functions / numerical operators) and string variables (including concatenation). There is a small section near the end on different ways to print these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "- At the point you give this lesson, students are getting their very first introduction to writing code. Don't assume they know anything! Be sure and explain carefully whenever you change even a little thing.\n",
    "- Encourage students to type, not copy and paste, for practice. Whenever possible, have students try and guess what will happen and try it out in the slide.\n",
    "- Note: If the code is too long for students to easily see in the embedded slide, there's an \"open with repl.it\" icon in the top right of the embed that will open the repl.it in a new, larger window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Define “variable”.\n",
    "- Use numerical and mathematical operators.\n",
    "- Use string variables.\n",
    "- Print complex variable structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "- A full hour has been allotted for this lesson because it is the first opportunity to let students get into writing code - so make sure to give them plenty of time to poke around in the repls!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the Parking Lot!\n",

The syntax for declaring a variable is what you want the variable to be named, followed by an equal sign, and finally what you want the variable to hold. Notice the space before and after the equal sign! Also, note that in Python, the equal sign doesn't evaluate things the way it does in math. Instead, it assigns them values.
