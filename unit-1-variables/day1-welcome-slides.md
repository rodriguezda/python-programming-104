# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Welcome to Python Programming!



## Overview
This lesson serves as the kick-off to your Python Programming class. Let's take the first 30 minutes of our time together to get things started on the right foot.

This lesson is designed to get introduces, get comfortable and excited to learn.

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Define class expectations and norms.
- Understand key concepts introduced in the pre-work

## Suggested Agenda

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:10 | Welcome |
| 0:10 - 0:20 | Meet and Greet |
| 0:20 - 0:30 | About the Course |
| 0:30 - 0:50 | About General Assembly |
<!---| 0:20 - 0:50 | [Pre-Work Recap](#activity-prework-recap-30-min) | Review the pre-work and level set. |--->
| 0:50 - 1:00 | Q&A + Close |

<!---## Before Class: Preparation
- Update the slides that follow with specific information about you, your class, your city and your local support team.
- Take some time to consider your expectations for learners and be prepared to talk about them.
- Choose an ice breaker to run that will allow learners to get to know one another in a fun, informal, low-stakes way. We have a list [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a91IqhzijI_3EqU-trJbZN4vDDSU0rXqgIrqGwsWM7I/edit) of fun activities - and other good slides to copy - for the students for you to choose from. And if you have some good ones, feel free to share your ideas with us!
- Before class, review completion data to understand how far your learners have progressed through the myGA prework.
-- If most of your learners have completed all of the prework, you should be able to breeze through this lesson very quickly.
-- If most of your learners have not completed all of the prework, you might want to spend more time on this lesson and reduce your timings for the rest of the lessons in Unit 1.--->



## Agenda
*Here's what we'll cover:*

## Meet Your Instructor


**Diego Rodriguez**

About Me:
- Data Scientist with Brightspot. I do statistical modeling, data analytics, data engineering, and machine learning.
- At General Assembly, I teach Python, and have previously taught Data Science. Also, I am a graduate of General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive bootcamp in 2017. I teach Python with an emphasis on data, data manipulation, data analysis, data science.
- I enjoy cooking, learning to sail, Marvel movies, AND teaching!

My Teaching Style:
- To the point! 
- I tend to repeat stuff! 
- I am open to feedback (there will be opportunities to provide it in real-time and after class)

---

## Meet Your Classmates!

Please share:

- Your name.
- Why you’re taking this course.
- One interesting thing you've learned lately OR one thing you like to do.

---

## Classroom Culture

Let’s all agree to:

- Treat each other with respect
- Be patient with outselves! (lean in to the learning process)
- Be curious
- Ask questions
- Make (coding) mistakes. These are learning opportunities!

Other notes (in no particular order):

- Five days seems like a lot of time; it's really not. It will go by quickly! Let's make it count!
- Any questions that I can't answer in the moment, I will put in our "Parking Lot." We will address these questions when feasible.
- You can snack during class. Just go on mute!
- Every day will be filled with "bloopers" - code will throw errors, notebooks will crash, etc. This is **normal**. We'll use each of these moments as learning opportunities, and we'll get through them together.
- During a lesson/demonstration/etc., please call out if you see something wrong with the code I'm presenting. I make mistakes, too!
- My cat will make a guest appearance at some point during our lessons! She is very chatty and social.
- Written Feedback will be asked of you at the end of every day - participation is not mandatory, but it helps me and GA understand how we're doing. 
- We will speed up if we need to; we will slow down if we need to.
- The pace of this course is FAST (faster than the 10 week program), but it is a good example of the pace of the immersive programs (just something to keep in mind!)
- As part of our lessons, you will be asked or will volunteer to screenshare and walk us through you code. It's part of the learning process!

## Moving on to Course Specifics...

Okay, GA is cool!

The classmates are cool.

Let's talk about the course.

---

## Course Specifics

- 6 days. Days 1-5 are lesson days. Day 6 is about the final project.
- Lesson days consist of lessons (0.5-1.5 hr), labs (1-2 hr), review sessions (0.5-1 hr), and breaks (0.25-1 hr).

---

## Office Hours

Office hours are currently scheduled for:
- Monday: 6PM EST
- Tuesday-Friday: 10AM EST
- Use this time to: discuss lesson material, homework problems, labs, the final project, ask industry questions, learn more about General Assembly programs.
- Hours are subject to change (based on need)

---


## How to get a certificate of completion

1. Complete all three homework assignments
2. Attend every class (If you do end up missing class, exceptions to this rule are made on a case-by-case basis. Please just Slack me if you plan on missing class, so I can be accountable.)
4. Complete the final project

---

## Course Materials

- Lessons for the day will be linked/updated at the beginning of the day.

The lessons are interactive to give as much programming practice as possible, so be sure you get the links and follow along!

---

## Homework


Homework:

  - Isn't graded, but is good practice.
  - We will go over it the next class!
  - Homework will be assigned Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
  - The homework is available from the main GitHub page.
  - It shouldn't take you more than 1-2 hours. 

---

## Labs


Labs:

  - Like homework, labs aren't graded, but is good practice.
  - We will go over each lab at the end of each lab session OR during Kickoff Sessions. 
  - There are five labs, they will be assigned each day, and to be completed in class.
  - The labs are available from the main GitHub page.


## Your Final Project

- Each day, you’ll build skills in Python and understand different ways in which you can use it to build applications.
- At the end of {Day 4}, you’ll choose a final project focus.
- On {Day 5 & 6} in class, you’ll build an application in Python based on your project focus area.
- At the end of {Day 6}, you’ll demo your project for the class.
- See **Final Project** [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ex8U8VvmmkvPSCllOSIcf3JPFNgwHWHf?usp=sharing) for more information about the final project.
- I will introduce the final project on day 1; we will be discussing it periodically on days 2-4; we will have classtime to work on the final project on days 5&6. My expectation is that you will work on it a little bit after class, too.
- Throughout the course, think of 1) what data you'd like to explore 2) a problem statement. I will provide you with an example of both.

## Okay - Let's get to it! Prework Review

- Did everyone complete it?

<!--- - Let's review it! 

We learned:

<aside class="notes">

1 MINUTE

**Teaching Tips**:

- There are slides on each concept following this.
- These are basic concepts to you, but potentially brand new to some students. Take your time to make sure everyone understands them.

</aside> --->

---

## Programming and Programming Languages

**Programming**:
- Writing step-by-step instructions in a way a computer can understand.

**Programming Languages**

- How we can give computers instructions.
- There are thousands! But we're learning **Python**.
- Specifically, Python 3.

<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- On this and all below, don't just read the slides. Add in your own interpretation.

</aside> --->

---

## Key Features of Python

- It's simple.
- It's versatile.
- It's always improving.
- It's popular!

---

## When to Use Python

- Putting up websites.
- Analyzing data.
- Building robots.

Most use cases!

<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside> --->

---

## When NOT to Use Python

Other programming languages exist - Python isn't great for everything!

- Mobile apps
- Huge programs
  - Python is interpreted - the computer reads it as it goes.
  - Other programming languages are read in advance!
- Sometimes too easy
  - Easy to expect things to work that don't!

<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside> --->

---

## Pseudocode

- Writing out your program in simple, step-by-step instructions using plain English.
- Not a programming language!
- Something you should always do.

```
First, open the fridge.
Then, take out the cheese.
Then, close the fridge.
```

<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Ask students what they think pseudocode is good for; then tell them.
- (e.g. to make sure you don't miss a step)

</aside> ---> 


---

<!--- ## Group Exercise: Programming in Pseudocode

Let's write pseudocode that gives instructions on how to {give someone a high five}.

Include every step required. Remember, computers are very literal!


<aside class="notes">

5 MINUTES

**Teaching Tips**:

- Feel free to change the example to some other simple task.
- Write on the board, here. Come up with nothing yourself!
- Encourage students to come up with the steps, and write them as students come up with them.
- You should end up with something like:
- "Raise arm"
- "Open hand; keep fingers together"
- "Wait for the other person to raise their arm and open their hand."
- "Swing your arm forward to slap their raised open hand with yours."
- "Lower your arm again."

</aside> --->

---

## Comments

- Programmer notes in code.
- The computer ignores them.
- Write your pseudocode here!

```python
# This is a comment!
```


<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Ask students what they think comments are good for; then tell them.
- (e.g. for your pseudocode; so others know what your program does; so you on Monday morning still know!).

</aside> --->


---

## Our First Line of Code


```python
print("Hello")
```


<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Teaching Tips**:
- Ask students what they think this does. If you deem it necessary, open a repl.it and demo it.

## Q&A and Summary

Any other questions?

Let's rock!

Next up, we'll explore something new in Python - variables.


<!--- <aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Check to see if there  are any lingering questions on the pre-work.
- Mention that next up, we'll explore something new in Python - variables.
