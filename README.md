# Python Programming

----

> This course introduces beginners to the Python programming language, with a brief working intro to a special topic: Data Science ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide)).
>> Instructor: [Diego Rodriguez](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/diego-rodriguez/16908)

## Overview
In this one-week Python Programming course, students will walk away with a foundation in Python programming. Students will also get an 8 hour dive into the Python library for data analysis, Pandas, and walk away with a project of their choosing they've built using that library, thus, being able to confidently manage data collection, data manipulation, data analysis, data visualization, and data presentation using Python and Pandas.

## About This Guide

This guide contains course information, links to course material, and links to additional resources. It should be used for the duration of this course - when in doubt, check this guide out! 

> After the end of the program, this repository will be made private. Students are encouraged to clone this repository at the end of the course for future use and reference (don't worry, we'll go over how to do that). 

## Course Details
Python Programming is a 40-hour course. This course is open to and encouraged for absolute beginners, delivered in a 5 day full-time format, with a sixth day used for final project preparation and presentation.

Once enrolled, students complete 3.5 hours of pre-work on the myGA platform.

In order to graduate and earn a course completion certificate, every student must complete a final project that meets or exceeds the minimum standards outlined in the project rubric. 

## Learning Objectives
The high-level learning objectives for this course are:

- Create a basic Python "app", using control flow, classes, and try/catch statements.
- Incorporate APIs, modules, and user input into a Python app.
- Use Pandas to create a visualization of a dataset (data science track).

Students cannot graduate unless they demonstrate mastery of the above learning objectives before the end of the course. Mastery is measured through assessment: homeworks, in-class activities and final projects.

## Homework
A Link to the homework assignments for this course are provided here: [course homework](xxxx). Homework is distributed at the end of the day, and reviewed at the start of the following day. Given the class size, your instructor can review your homework assignment and provide feedback, if requested. 

## Labs
Links to the five lab assignments for this course are included in the Course Schedule in the section below. Each day, the students will receive a lab to complete. During lab time, the instructor will introduce the lab, and then approximately 1-1.5 hours will be alloted for students to complete the labs independently (depending on the class size, breakout sessions may be utilized instead, so students can work on the lab together in groups). Afterward, the class will review each lab together as a group.
