    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson starts with a recap of all of the topics covered up to this point, giving students a final chance to express their questions before we move beyond the basics. Most slides are in a \"Lecture + Question -> Answer\" format. It then has a very quick overview of the upcoming unit — user input and file I/O, abstraction, modules, and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you go through this lesson, do frequent checks for understanding. It's important that students understand everything before we add more complicated things like `itertools` and APIs.\n",
