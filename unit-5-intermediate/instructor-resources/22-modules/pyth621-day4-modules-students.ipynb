    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson walks through the idea of modules, using the `random` module to look at documentation and methods. Then, it segues into a few longer exercises with PyTime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes or Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries were covered extremely briefly in the pre-work (in the Python Introduction lesson), so you can call back to that. They've also used itertools, so you can reference that. This is just a small taste of the many, many modules out there. Highly encourage students to explore more on their own!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add packages and modules to a Python program.\n",
    "* Create a program utilizing Pytime.\n",
    "* Navigate library documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration\n",
    "40 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be easy to get carried away and spend a lot of time either playing around with the modules or reading through the docs. Keep an eye on the clock and move on to the next topic once you've covered a few basic examples. The goal is to understand modules, not to become a pro at any particular one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the Parking Lot!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many modules, students may start asking questions along the lines of `Hey, have you used the XXX module?` These are great questions as they reveal a lot of the student's passion and interest! Insofar as possible, try to answer those questions! If you find yourself running short of time, however, write the module name down in the parking lot so you can follow up with that student during a lab or a break.\n",

    "## Differentiation and Extensions\n",
    "- Don't let slower students be frustrated if they're hung up on a particular function. The main point is that there are other files that they can use that have functions - that's really it.\n",
    "- For more advanced students, encourage them to experiment with other functions in the modules.\n",
