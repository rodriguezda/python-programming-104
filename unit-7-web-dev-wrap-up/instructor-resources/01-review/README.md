## Overview
There are no slides associated with this lesson. Take this time to work on whatever students need — ask if they have specific questions and go over things with which you noted students were struggling. Pull up a Python interpreter or Jupyter Notebook and walk through it. Address any outstanding questions in the parking lot.


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Have any final questions answered.
- Feel confident in their Python abilities.

## Duration
30 minutes

## Materials and Preparation
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Send students the link to the presentation slides.

## Differentiation and Extensions
- If students aren't forthcoming with questions, assign a few recap activities — pull from unused homework assignments or, for example, create a Pandas app with a significant chunk of logic.

## Lesson Procedure

### Activity: Welcome (2 minutes)
> Introduce the lesson’s objectives and agenda.

---

### Activity: Recap (13 min)
> Go over any topics with which students particularly struggled.

> **Teaching Tips**:
> - Consider going over the unit lab once again, line by line, to be sure they understand it, as it incorporates almost all of the topics taught.
> - Recap Python fundamentals, as well!
> - Topics students generally struggle with are sets versus tuples versus lists, dictionaries, `**args` and `*kwargs`.

---

### Activity: Q&A (13 minutes)
> Take questions and address outstanding parking-lot items.

> **Teaching Tips**:
> - If students aren't forthcoming, start assigning exercises in order of difficulty to see where they get tripped up.

---

### Activity: Summary (2 minutes)
> Wrap up the learning and share next steps.
