## Lesson Procedure

### Activity: Welcome (2 minutes)
> Introduce the lesson’s objectives and agenda.

---

### Activity: Presenting Projects (40 minutes)
> Encourage students to present what they've been working on.

> **Teaching Tips**:
> - Only allow students three minutes each; less for a larger class.
> - Some students might not want to present, and that's fine! This is just their chance to show off what they've done.
> - Compliment their projects! They've worked hard.

---

### Activity: Continued Learning (16 minutes)
> Discuss the steps students can take to continue on their programming journey.

> **Teaching Tips**:
> - Ask students what they're interested in — web development, data science, etc.
> - Give tips for each group. Encourage those interested in web development to review the "Next Steps" presentation from the previous unit.
> - If GA has a class on that topic (for example, Web Development Immersive or Data Science Immersive), encourage them to look into it!

### Activity: Summary (2 minutes)
> Wrap up the learning and share next steps.

> **Teaching Tips:**
