    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson introduces local and global scope with a few examples. If there is time, give students examples of broken programs that mix up global and local scopes, and ask them to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define variable scope.\n",
    "* Explain the order of scope precedence that Python follows when resolving variable names.\n",

This maintains the integrity _of the interface between the data and the function that is called_.\n",
