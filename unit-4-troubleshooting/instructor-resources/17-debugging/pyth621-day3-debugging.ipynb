    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson is meant to give students the skills needed to debug their own code. There is a mix of demo, You Do, and We Do to keep it fresh while running through many common errors. We throw a lot of errors at them very quickly - the idea is to get them comfortable recognizing errors and solving them, not to memorize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it guides students in how to use `Try`-`Except` blocks when errors are expected/unavoidable. Last, some time is spent teaching students how to handle situations that are problematic, but don't usually throw errors specifically, including endless loops, off-by-one errors, and logical errors.\n",
