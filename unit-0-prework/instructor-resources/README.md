# Prework Expectations for Python Programming

In the most recent update to the Python Programming Part-Time course (2.1) several changes were made to the student pre-work. 

## Why? 

As always, changes were made in an effort to enhance the student and instructor experience. 

## Required Prework

Students (of both the 10-week and 1-week formats) are expected to complete the learning path titled "Python Part Time Prework" which included the following lessons before the first day of class. 

Students will complete these lessons on [myGA](https://my.generalassemb.ly/).


Lesson Title | Learning Objectives |
------------ | ------------- |
Welcome to Python Programming | Describe the flow of the course. Install Python 3.|
How Computers Work | Define what a computer is and what it isn’t. Summarize the history of computing. Explain the basics of how computers work. |
Introducing the Layers of Abstraction | Define abstraction. Summarize how layers of abstraction allow programs and users to interact with computers in ways that are more intuitive to humans. Differentiate between a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface (CLI). |
Using the Command Line Interface  | Explain the command line and why developers use it. Navigate through your computer’s files structure via the CLI. |
Git for Version Control | Explain why Git is an important tool for developers. Use several of the most common Git commands. Describe the phases of Git tracking. |
Intro to Github  | Define GitHub and its benefits. Describe each step of the GitHub flow.|
Introduction to Python | Describe the history of Python and the pros and cons of the programming language. Write a basic Python script.|
Data Types in Python |Define primitive Python data types and their common use cases. Manipulate data using numerical operators. Convert data types.|
Manipulating Variables in Python | Declare and use variables in Python. Define lists, tuples, sets, and variables along with their common methods. Distinguish between the complex data types. |


## Additional Python Lessons

Students in the 1-week format are *highly* encouraged to complete the second learning path titled "Additional Python Lessons" before their first day. 

Students in the 10-week format will be assigned the lessons in this learning path for homework throughout the first few weeks of the course. Which lesson to assign when can be found in the instructor pacing guide. 


Lesson Title | Learning Objectives |
------------ | ------------- |
Control Flow in Python |Explain why control flow is an important concept in programming. Write loops and conditional statements in Python to control the flow of a program. |
Functions in Python | Write and run functions in Python to make your code more concise. Demonstrate how to return values.|
Objects and Classes |Create an object from a class using instantiation. Pass instance methods and variables to objects using the “self” argument.|
Error Handling in Python |Troubleshoot the three most common Python programming errors. Determine when to use the “try-except” exception to bypass errors. Identify when you might use the “raise” keyword.|
