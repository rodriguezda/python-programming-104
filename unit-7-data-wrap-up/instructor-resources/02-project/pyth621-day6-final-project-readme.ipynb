    "## Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like you to have something tangible to show for having taken this course with us, so let's use your newly acquired Pandas skills to make a data-pulling app!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Got Ideas?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to make a website about anything you'd like, as long as it meets all the requirements listed below. If you're having trouble coming up with a topic, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding a fun data set and basing it on that.\n",
    "* Making an app that contrasts data from your hobbies.\n",
    "* Making something you think would improve your life in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to share resources and inspiration with your classmates!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have a Pandas app in Jupyter Notebooks. You will work individually on this project, but feel free to share inspiration, resources, or cool data sets that you find with your classmates!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment **must** include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data pulled from at least one data set.\n",
    "   - Get creative! Tons of free data sets exist! Ask your instructor or classmates for ideas.\n",
    "2. Data displayed in a minimum of two different visualizations.\n",
    "    - Take care that they're the best choice of visualizations for the data and are easy to comprehend.\n",
    "3. Cleaning the data â€” handling of NULL values or other potential errors in the data.\n",
    "4. Core Python topics. At minimum:\n",
    "      - Dictionaries *or* sets *or* tuples.\n",
    "      - `**args` *or* `kwargs` *or* `*kwargs`.\n",
    "      - Basic debugging, such as a `try-except` block *(only if necessary)*.\n",
    "      - A class.\n",
    "      - User input *or* reading from a file.\n",
    "5. Comments, so another developer can easily see what your app does.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested Ways to Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning ahead, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.\n",
    "* **Read the docs** for whatever technologies or data sets you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow! This isn't always the case, however, learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.\n",
    "* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Resources\n",

    "Your project will be evaluated based on the rubric below.\n",

    "| Score | Expectations |\n",
    "| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| 0 | Incomplete. |\n",
    "| 1 | Does not meet expectations. |\n",

    "| 3 | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you! |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A zero-to-three grading scale may not intuitively make sense, so here is an example using the criteria as if your assignment were to cook a pizza:\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria | **0** Incomplete. | **1** Does not meet expectations. | **2** Meets expectations. | **3**  Exceeds expectations. |\n",
    ":--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---\n",
    "Crust | No crust present. Submission is just cheese and sauce on a plate. | Pizza has a crust, but it is raw. | Crust is cooked thoroughly.| Crust is golden brown and just thin enough without being too thick.\n",
    "Cheese | No cheese present. | Cheese is made of soy. | Cheese covers the pizza from edge to edge. | Cheese is delicious, plentiful, and melted to perfection."
