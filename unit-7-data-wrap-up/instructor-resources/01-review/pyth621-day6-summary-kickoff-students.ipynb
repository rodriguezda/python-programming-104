    "## Overview\n",
    "There are no slides associated with this lesson. Take this time to work on whatever students need — ask if they have specific questions and go over things you noted students were struggling on. Pull up a Python interpreter and walk through it. Address any outstanding questions in the parking lot.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this lesson, students will:\n",
    "- Have any final questions answered.\n",
    "- Feel confident in their Python abilities.\n",
