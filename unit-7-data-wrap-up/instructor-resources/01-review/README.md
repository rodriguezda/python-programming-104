## Overview
There are no slides associated with this lesson. Take this time to work on whatever students need — ask if they have specific questions and go over things you noted students were struggling on. Pull up a Python interpreter and walk through it. Address any outstanding questions in the parking lot.


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Have any final questions answered.
- Feel confident in their Python abilities.

## Duration
