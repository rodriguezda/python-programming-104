    "> - Only allow students three minutes each; less for a larger class.\n",
    "> - Some students might not want to present, and that's fine! This is just their chance to show off what they've done.\n",
    "> - Compliment their projects! They've worked hard.\n",

    "> Discuss the steps students can take to continue on their programming journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Teaching Tips**:\n",
    "> - Ask students what they're interested in — web development, front-end, back-end, full-stack, pure programming, data science, etc.\n",
    "> - Give tips for each group. Encourage those interested in web development to review the \"Next Steps\" presentation from the previous unit.\n",
    "> - If GA has a class on that topic (for example, Web Development Immersive or HTML, CSS, & Web Design Circuit), encourage them to look into it!\n",
    "\n",
